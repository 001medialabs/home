<h2 id="about-001-media-labs">About 001 Media Labs</h2>
<p> My name is Chris. I’m originally from New York City and currently based in Germany. My background sits at the intersection of photography, computers, and generative art. These fields that all share a common thread: experimentation, and intention.
For many years I worked primarily with photography and generative art, exploring how images, code, and process can create emotional responses and spark curiosity. I’m drawn to making things that connect people, provoke thought, and inspire action rather than passive consumption.
001 Media Labs grew out of the spirit of makerspaces and hackerspaces where people from different backgrounds come together to exchange ideas, build things, and learn from one another. 

</p>
<p> Through 001 Media Labs, my goal is to create a space where multidisciplinary artists, technologists, and storytellers can collaborate, challenge assumptions, and push ideas forward.
More recently, my focus has shifted toward filmmaking. What excites me most about film is its ability to combine all of my interests: visuals, technology, structure, and emotion into a single medium. I’m deeply passionate about creating work with essential tools, strong constraints, and striking visuals. 
For me, filmmaking isn’t about excess or spectacle; it’s about clarity, intention, and creating images that linger and make people think.</p>

<h2 id="film-philosophy">Film Philosophy</h2>
<h3 id="rule-1-less-is-more">Less Is More</h3>
<p>Early in my photography journey, I took thousands of photos. Some were good, many weren’t. Shooting without thinking twice about the shot has its advantages. When reviewing photos, I discovered some hidden gems that I didn&#39;t realize were that good.</p>
<p>I played around with film photography for a short time and while the cost didn&#39;t justify itself, I learned valuable lessons. A roll of film gives about 16 shots. Not less not more. Therefore each shot needs to be thoughtful and certain. Every frame matters.
Each decision carries weight.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve taken this same approach towards filmmaking. I shoot with a relatively small SD card of 256GB which equates to ~15 minutes of footage when shooting RAW. This implies that
        every shots need to be thought of way before the camera rolls. There is little space for waste. Hence everything from how lighting reflects on the skin, will the camera fit in this space? are there echoes? needs to be though out.   </p>

<h3 id="rule-2-lighting-over-gear">Lighting Over Gear</h3>
<p>You don&#39;t need $5,000 worth of gear for good lighting. Lighting is important but lighting gear isn&#39;t. Rather than investing thousands into lighting equipment, I chose to invest in a camera with exceptional color (12-bit) and dynamic range.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, I work with existing light sources. That means locations are chosen carefully, not just for their aesthetic, but for the quality of light they naturally provide—or the absence of it. Natural and practical lighting create images that feel grounded and honest. Instead of forcing light into a scene, I prefer to observe it, understand it, and shape my shots around what already exists.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="rule-3-1080p-vs-4k-is-the-wrong-question"> 1080p vs 4K</h3>
<p> What matters more is color, dynamic range, exposure. </p>
<p>1080p is significantly better than most people expect. It fits my style well, producing smoother edges and a more organic feel, while keeping file sizes manageable. Shooting in 4k is not just about the camera but also upkeeping a storage solution and a computer to store and process the footage respectively.</p>
<p>The main drawback of 1080p is compression, especially on platforms like YouTube, which use lower-quality encoders for native 1080p uploads.. The way to get around that is toupscale the footage when rendering to have YouTube compress with a much better encoder and have the least reduction in quality. In the end, technical choices are always in service of the image, not the other way around.</p>
